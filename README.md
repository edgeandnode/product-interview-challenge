# Product Engineering Interview Challenge

This is a Next.js React app interview challenge for the Edge & Node's Product Engineering team.

Create a private repo based on this one and add the interviewers as collaborators (`IainM22`, `hasparus`, `cmwhited`, `dnfodjo`, `nasmr`). \
You can also email us a [git bundle](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle) of your repo history if you prefer.

We recommend spending no more than 4 hours on this challenge. If you don't finish, that's ok.

Use any GraphQL client and styling solution you're comfortable with. The focus of this is more on general programming and problem-solving than on specific technologies.

## The task

In this exercise, you will create an Epochs table that has sorting, search and/or pagination. Data will be available at the endpoint provided in the .env file.

First off, watch the [video](https://storage.googleapis.com/graph-web/blog/The%20Graph%20-%20Table.mov) to see what the end result should look like. *(Note: The table in the video shows Indexers but for this assignment we will focus on Epochs, not Indexers)*

Designs can be found [here](https://invis.io/6WZZK4QUGFZ). Here is the [Sketch file](https://storage.googleapis.com/graph-web/blog/The%20Graph%20-%20Table.sketch). All the assets can be found [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/graph-web/blog/Table%20Assets.zip).

1. You can find the subgraph here and use the playground to see the schema and make queries: https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/graphprotocol/graph-network-mainnet.
2. For this challenge, we will query the Entity called `Epoch`.
3. After you get all of the epochs (or some of them, if you use pagination), render them in a table with the columns as in Designs.
4. All columns should be sortable in `asc/desc` order. Default order should be by Epoch's `startBlock`. Make use of GraphQL queries.
5. Search should only be implemented for Epoch's `startBlock`. Make sure to use a GraphQL query.
6. As a bonus, there are a few animations/transitions (check the video).
7. Another bonus, the table should be horizontally scrollable on narrow screens.

## Setup and development

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `pnpm install` to install all dependencies. If you don't have PNPM you can install it using [Node.js Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html).
3. Run `pnpm dev` to run the development server.
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
